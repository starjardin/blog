        <h2>
          My favourite games
        </h2>
        <p>
          Firstly, I loved playing hide and seek with my peers when I still did not go to school. When I was about eight years old I was really keen on playing football after I finihed off my school. My favourite players were <a href="images/ronaldo.jpg"><img src="thumbnail.jpg" alt="Ronaldo"></a>, <a href="images/zidane.jpg"><img src="thumbnail.jpg" alt="Zidane"></a>, and <a href="images/main_-_ronaldinho.jpg"><img src="thumbnail.jpg" alt="Ronaldhino"></a>. I wished I would have been like them.

          My first school
        </h2>
        <p>
          The first time I went to school, I hated to go to school but my parents forced me to go. However, once I got friends at school, I loved going to school. I did ok at school and so my best friends. I had two best friends and until now we are still friends.

        <h2>
          My favourite subject at school
        </h2>
        <p>
          I always enjoyed learning Maths and Science. I was happy and feeling strong, motivated when we were doing those scientific sessions. I love solving problems with my closest friends and my brother in Maths. I was ok with the other subjects. My least favourite subject was Malagasy, I hated it and I was even bored to see my Malagasy copybook. I was not interested in it at all. When I was lazy to got o school, my brother always said <q>don't put off tomorrow what you can do to day</q>, and I said that to him as well when he was lazy.

        </h2>
        <p>
          I love listening to music. It helps me to stay strong when I am having problems. Rap is one of my favourite music. I like the other genres but from time to time. I enjoy slow music when I want to sleep, I like listening to <i>kilalaky</i> in the morning
