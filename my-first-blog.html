          How did it go ?
        </h3>
        <p>
          At the beggining it was hard because it was such new skill I have ever learnt, even though I enjoyed it so much. We have very cool teachers as well. After a month we started to write markup languages such as
          <b>
            markdown
          </b> and the most interesting one which is
          <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=html5+doctor&oq=html&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i59l2j69i60j69i61j69i60l2.5056j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" >html
          </a>. Now  we are still dealing with the html language.

        <h3>
          How is it going now ?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I enjoy my class at the moment. I love learning and descovering new topics everyday.  One thing I enjoy the most is having exercises after doing a new topic in order to understand the lesson much clearer. Lessons are interesting because they are new to me and really cool.

          About the atmospohere.
        </h3>
        <p>
          We are all from different backgrounds but the atmosphere is extremely good. I love interacting with my team. We can learn lots of different cultures here because everyone has different culture. We speak in English here as our default languge even though there are lots of peple who are not English and that is nice as well.
