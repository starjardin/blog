        Sport that I want to take up.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I like trying new thing that I have never done before or I am not always doing everyday. I would like to take up new sport which is football. There are many players that influenced me. I like watching them while they are playing. Football also one of the most popular sports. It is cool and lots of people like it as well. I like collective sport rather than individual because I love playing with teams .

      <h2>
        My least favourite sport.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I love doing every single sport but I don' t like doing rugby, boxing since they are  quiete dangerous. I have seen lots of matches in those sports never inspired me. Lots of my friends like doing boxing and often they get injered from it, that is one reason that makes me don' t want to do it.
