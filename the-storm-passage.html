        <h2>The passage of the storm.</h2>
        <p>
          It came early in the morning when everyone was still asleep. For us, the storm woke us up because it broke our roof at 4:05:00 in the morning. As a result, we had to fix our roof during the rain in order to prevent it from being collapse. Even thoough we did that, we had to move in the class room since our house is not strong enough. It winded very strong for about two hours then it rained a lot after that. the rain did not stop by the end of the day. What we could do was stay in the classroom and read books in the morning and we had a writing test with our director Sam.

          The disasters that were left after the storm
        </h2>
        <p>
          The storm damaged most of the villages in Mahanoro. <a href="images/innondation.jpg">There was a big flood that flooded all around the town.</a>. Lots of people didn't have anywhere to stay because their houses were damaged  and full of water as well. Any  vehicles could work because the water filled all of the surroundings in the villages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The storm left lots of damages in the villages. There were lots of trees which were fell over, houses were broken down because the wind was so strong. A tree was fell over to our toilet, fortunately the toilet is a little bit strong so the tree did not really break it.
